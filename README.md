# ForProx - Build Your Own HTTP Forward Proxy Server

ForProx is a proxy server created based on a challenge #51 of [CodingChallenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-forward-proxy) by John Crickett.
Server is implemented in Java.

## Description

This challenge is to build your own HTTP forward proxy server. Forward proxies provide the ability to enforce Internet browsing restrictions.

ForProx does not implement step 3 from the challenge as it would be very inconvenient to set up website content control for HTTPS connections.

Verification of proxy server is done on the unit tests level where HTTP client is created and used to connect with website through the proxy.

## Requirements

- Java (JDK 17+)
- Git

## Usage

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/malahor1610/ForProx.git
```
First - to use proxy server the SSL certificate needs to be generated and provided to _resources_ directory with name _proxykeystore.jks_ and storepass _changeit_

For testing purpose I suggest using self-signed certificate generated by Java keytool

```bash
java-home/keytool.exe -genkeypair -alias proxycert -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 365 -keystore proxykeystore.jks -storepass changeit
```


To start the server, run the following

```bash
./mvnw.cmd compile exec:java
```

Proxy server should be running at port 9898.
